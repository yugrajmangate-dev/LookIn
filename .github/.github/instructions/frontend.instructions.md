# Frontend specific rules
- All Next.js components must use the App Router (`app/` directory).
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Do not use inline CSS.
- Use Lucide React for all icons.
- All components should be functional and use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Enforce strict TypeScript typing for all props and API responses.
